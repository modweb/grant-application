# Culture Works Grant Application

Grant Application system built for [Culture Works](http://cultureworks.org) in
partnership with [CreativeFuse Initiative](http://creativefuse.org)

## Notes

### Deadlines

The `deadlineDate` property is stored as UTC. It's easiest to set this date to 1 day past the actual deadline of the application to allow for a safe buffer with respect to timezones. If your application requires an exact deadline time, be sure to specify the time zone in the user interface.
